# Server Bot
A discord.py bot that allows easy communication from Discord to your (virtual private/dedicated/home) server.

## This README is still a work in progress.
Installation is easy:
- Clone the repository (`git clone https://github.com/lieuwe-berg/server-bot.git`).
- Navigate to the root folder of your cloned repository in the terminal.
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Now you have cloned the repository and installed the required packages.
To invite your bot to your server and run it:
- Create a bot application and invite your bot (see [this](https://anidiots.guide/getting-started/getting-started-long-version#step-1-creating-your-app-and-bot-account), return here when you reach step two).
- Fill out the config-example.py and rename it config.py when you're done.
- Run `py bot.py`
- Enjoy. Try the help command for a list of commands.
